---
## A custom PyTorch inspired Framework for Deep learning built using Python and Numpy  from scratch:

• Implemented functionalities such as Linear Layer, Convolutional layers, Recurrent layers, Optimizers, Loss functions,
Self attention, MultiHead attention, Temporal Attention, stochastic Attention with gumbel softmax, Transformer architecture, GANs, 
Reverse automatic differentiation, Activation functions, Dropout, Layer Norm, BatchNorm, etc.


• Converted distributed and simple scanning MLPs to CNNs.
• Implemented architectures include MLPs, CNNs, ResNets, LSTMs and GRUs, Transformer and GAN.
• Also implemented batchnorm2D, meanpool2D, maxpool2D,LayerNorm, packed sequences and other 
 major pytorch utilities.
